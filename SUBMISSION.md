RouteFinder application is built using Java, Spring Boot and Maven.

How to Run:
To build the project, you would need maven installed.
Navigate to the RouteFinder folder and use 'mvn clean install' command to build the project.
 
You can run the jar using  java -jar ./target/shortest-route-finder-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

I have added the jar in the RouteFinder folder as well.
